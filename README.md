dalli
=========

Dalli is a high performance pure Ruby client for accessing memcached servers.  It works with memcached 1.4+ as it uses the newer binary protocol.  The API tries to be mostly compatible with memcache-client with the goal being to make it a drop-in replacement for Rails.

The name is a variant of Salvador Dali for his famous painting [The Persistence of Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory).

Installation and Usage
------------------------

    gem install dalli

    require 'dalli'
    dc = Dalli::Client.new('localhost:11211')
    dc.set('abc', 123)
    value = dc.get('abc')
