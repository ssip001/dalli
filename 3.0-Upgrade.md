# Dalli 3.0

This major version update contains several backwards incompatible changes.

* **:dalli_store** has been removed. Users should migrate to the
  official Rails **:mem_cache_store**, documented in the [caching
guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#activesupport-cache-memcachestore).
* Attempting to store a larger value than allowed by memcached used to
  print a warning and truncate the value. This now raises an error to
  prevent silent data corruption.
* Errors marshalling values now raise rather than just printing an error.
* The Rack session adapter has been removed. Users should [vendor the
  session adapter code in 2.7](https://github.com/petergoldstein/dalli/blob/2.x/lib/) or
  switch to an alternative session adapter, like Redis or cookie.
* Support for the high-performance `kgio` gem has been removed, as it is
  no longer relevant in Ruby 2.3+.
* Removed inline native code, use Ruby 2.3+ support for bsearch instead.
* The CAS operations previously in 'dalli/cas/client' have been
  integrated into 'dalli/client'.
